# Arduino IDE Dark Theme

Install the `DebinixDark` for `Arduino IDE 1.8.x` and later. This Arduino IDE theme is inspired by the Visual Studio Code (VSC) extension `C++ UI Dark Theme`. 
A theme downloaded more than 12 million times. Thus a lot of developers love it. However, `Arduino IDE 2.x` does not yet support custom themes.

## Why you should use the theme

Looking at the white background screen for a long time is unsuitable for the eyes. Your eyes become tired and causes distraction. 
In addition, `DebinixDark` theme syntax highlighting improves the readability and context of the text and helps spot errors quicker. 

* Another reason is that it's so simple to install, thus no reason not to try it out.

## How to Install?

Although you find some existing Arduino IDE themes, most are old, and the recommended installation is outdated.

* Navigate to the [Releases page](https://github.com/berrak/DebinixDark/releases).
* Download the latest released ZIP archive in the `sketchbook/theme` folder
* Open Arduino IDE.
* Open `File->Preferences` and find the `DebinixDark` in the `Theme` drop-down menu.
* Restart Arduino IDE, and enjoy.

## FAQ

**Q:** Why are all repository files included in the downloaded zip archive?

**A:** This is to simplify the installation in the theme folder, and Arduino IDE requires that the zip archive has a specific layout to work as a custom theme. 
Any extra files bundled and included in the theme folder do not negatively affect the IDE.

## Credits

The `DebinixDark` theme continues in the footsteps of the previous work by [Jeff Thompson](https://github.com/jeffThompson/DarkArduinoTheme) and others. Unfortunately, the original theme is no longer maintained.
